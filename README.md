## About

An evolving digital library focused on the botanical history of the Carolinas. Focuses of research are digital imagery of botanical specimens from the Sloane Herbarium in London, with associated electronic texts, data collections, and indices. This project uses the [CITE Infrastructure](http://folio.furman.edu/projects/cite/index.html), developed by N. Smith and C. Blackwell for the [Homer Multitext](http://folio.furman.edu/projects/botanicacaroliniana/index.html) (C. Du√© & M. Ebbott, editors).
